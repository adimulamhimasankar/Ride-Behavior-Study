# Ride-Behavior-Study

Project Overview:

This project delves into the ride patterns of bike-sharing platform users. By distinguishing between casual and annual riders, the study provides insights into rider preferences and behaviors, which can aid in refining service offerings.

Date:

August 2023 - September 2023

Technologies Used:

RStudio: For data analysis and visualization.
Google Docs: For documentation and report generation.

Key Findings:

Casual Riders:

Predominantly opt for rides within the city.
Mostly active during weekends.
Prefer leisurely rides rather than commutes.

Annual Riders:

Exhibit versatility in bike selection, choosing both electric and traditional bikes.
Primarily use the service for weekday commutes.
Often take rides outside the city.

Recommendations:

For Casual Riders: Introduce city sightseeing packages or collaborate with local tourism boards to provide guided bike tours.
For Annual Riders: Offer discounted weekday packages or loyalty programs to encourage more rides. Also, consider providing amenities for longer rides out of the city.

Further Work

While the current study offers a comprehensive understanding of ride behaviors, future work can explore:

Rider feedback to understand areas of improvement.
Economic analysis to determine pricing strategies.
Comparative study with competitors to identify gaps and opportunities.

Collaboration

Open to suggestions, improvements, or any insights that can further enhance this study. Feel free to fork and submit pull requests.
